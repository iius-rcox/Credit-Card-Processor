# ⚠️ Docker Containers Not Running

**Current Status**: Connection refused on both ports 3000 and 8000
**Action Required**: Start Docker containers before testing

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Run These Commands Now

```bash
cd /Users/rogercox/Credit-Card-Processor

# Start all containers
docker-compose up -d

# Or use the automated test script
./run-full-test-sequence.sh
```

---

## ✅ Verify Containers Are Running

After starting, check status:

```bash
# Check all containers
docker-compose ps

# Should show:
# NAME                      STATUS
# credit-card-postgres      Up (healthy)
# credit-card-redis         Up (healthy)
# credit-card-backend       Up
# credit-card-frontend      Up
```

## 🧪 Test Endpoints

Once containers are up:

```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected",...}

# Test frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
