# Feature Specification: Better Status Updates

**Feature Branch**: `006-better-status-updates`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Better Status Updates

Implement backend processing to show much more detailed progress status. It should have separate phases including upload and counters based on progress through the total number of regex matches as it runs through them"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Need for detailed progress tracking during PDF processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users uploading PDFs
   ‚Üí Actions: Monitor processing progress in real-time
   ‚Üí Data: Progress phases, page counters, completion percentages
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must show granular progress, not just 90% stuck
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All clarified through stakeholder discussion (2025-10-08)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User uploads PDFs and sees detailed progress
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Progress events, processing phases, extraction status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí No ambiguities remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user uploading credit card statements and receipt PDFs for reconciliation, I want to see detailed progress updates during processing so that I understand what's happening and can estimate how long it will take, rather than seeing a progress bar stuck at 90% for an extended period.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded two PDF files, **When** processing begins, **Then** the system shows a summary progress view on top and detailed per-file progress below
2. **Given** the system is processing pages within a file, **When** viewing detailed progress, **Then** the system displays page-level progress (e.g., "Page 3 of 10")
3. **Given** the system has multiple processing phases, **When** each phase completes, **Then** the status text above the progress bar updates to show the current phase: "Uploading", "Processing File 1 of 2", or "Generating Reports"
4. **Given** processing is in progress, **When** the user views the progress display, **Then** they see the current phase name and specific progress details including phase completion status and current operation (e.g., "Uploading: 100%, Processing File 1 of 2: 45% (Page 3/10), Generating Reports: 0%")
5. **Given** all processing phases complete, **When** the final phase finishes, **Then** the progress indicator shows 100% and status changes to "Complete" at the next update interval (2-3 seconds)
6. **Given** a file's detailed progress reaches 100%, **When** moving to the next file, **Then** the summary progress increases proportionally and detailed view resets to show the next file at 0%

### Edge Cases
- What happens when processing fails during a specific phase? (Progress shows which phase failed, and all partial results are discarded)
- What happens if the server restarts mid-processing? (System displays an error message indicating processing was interrupted)
- How does the system handle very large files with thousands of regex matches? (Progress updates batch every 2-3 seconds at page-level granularity to avoid UI overload)
- What if processing takes longer than expected in one phase? (User still sees page-level progress within that phase, not appearing frozen)
- How should progress be displayed if the user navigates away and comes back? (Progress is retrievable from the session)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Progress Tracking**
- **FR-001**: System MUST divide processing into three distinct phases with user-facing names: "Uploading", "Processing File X of Y", and "Generating Reports"
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide progress percentage for each processing phase
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide status updates that describe the current operation being performed, batched every 2-3 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST track extraction progress at page granularity (e.g., "Page 5 of 12")
- **FR-005**: System MUST update progress at 2-3 second intervals to maintain perceived activity without overwhelming the UI
- **FR-018**: System MUST display both aggregate progress (summary view on top) and per-file progress (detailed view below) when processing multiple PDFs
- **FR-019**: System MUST show which specific file is currently being processed in the detailed view (e.g., "Processing File 1 of 2")
- **FR-020**: System MUST map detailed progress to summary progress such that each file's completion (0-100%) contributes proportionally to the overall percentage

**Status Information**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the current processing phase name as status text above the progress bar (e.g., "Uploading", "Processing File 1 of 2", "Generating Reports")
- **FR-007**: System MUST show quantitative progress within processing phases at page granularity (e.g., "Page 3 of 10")
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist progress state so the user can refresh the page without losing progress visibility
- **FR-009**: System MUST indicate overall completion percentage across all phases in the summary view
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide relative progress information (percentage and page counts) without time estimates
- **FR-021**: System MUST display phase completion status alongside current operation details (e.g., "Uploading: 100%, Processing File 1 of 2: 45% (Page 3/10), Generating Reports: 0%")

**User Experience**
- **FR-011**: Progress display MUST update without requiring user interaction (automatic polling or push updates every 2-3 seconds)
- **FR-012**: System MUST show meaningful status messages that explain what's happening (not generic "Processing...")
- **FR-013**: The user MUST be able to see progress updates after navigating away and returning
- **FR-014**: Progress updates MUST include enough detail to reassure users that processing is actively occurring
- **FR-022**: System MUST display final "Complete" status at the next regular update interval (maintaining consistent 2-3 second batching behavior)

**Error Handling**
- **FR-015**: System MUST indicate which phase failed if processing encounters an error
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide enough context in error messages to understand what went wrong during processing
- **FR-017**: System MUST discard all partial results if processing fails at any phase (no incomplete data persisted)
- **FR-023**: System MUST display an error message if the server restarts mid-processing, indicating that processing was interrupted

**Out of Scope**
- User cancellation of in-progress processing (not included in this feature)
- Time estimates or ETA display (not included in this feature)
- Post-completion timing summaries (not included in this feature)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Processing Phase**: Represents a major stage of PDF processing (Uploading, Processing File X of Y, Generating Reports). Has a name, order, and completion status.
- **Progress Event**: Update about processing status batched every 2-3 seconds. Contains phase identifier, percentage complete, current operation description, and counters (e.g., pages processed / total pages).
- **Extraction Progress**: Tracks progress at page granularity. Includes current page number, total pages, and current file being processed.
- **Session Processing State**: Persistent representation of processing progress. Stores current phase, phase-specific progress, overall completion percentage, and status messages.
- **Multi-File Progress**: Aggregates progress across multiple files. Contains list of files with individual progress, current file being processed, and combined completion percentage in summary view.
- **Progress Hierarchy**: Two-level display structure with summary progress (aggregate) on top and detailed progress (per-file, page-level) below.
