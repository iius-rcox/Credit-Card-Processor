## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should the system match an expense transaction to a receipt record? ‚Üí A: By amount + employee
- Q: What are the required columns for the pvault format CSV export? ‚Üí A: Transaction ID, Transaction Date, Transaction Amount, Transaction Name, Vendor Invoice #, Invoice Date, Header Description, Job, Phase, Cost Type, GL Account, Item Description, UM, Tax, Pay Type, Card Holder, Credit Card Number, Credit Card Vendor
- Q: What level of progress visibility should the system provide during PDF processing? ‚Üí A: Detailed progress (percentage + step descriptions)
- Q: How should the system respond to PDF parsing failures? ‚Üí A: Error message + partial results
- Q: How should the Excel report distinguish between expenses missing receipts vs missing GL/project codes? ‚Üí A: Single status column

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user needs to reconcile credit card expenses against expense receipts to identify missing documentation and generate compliant export files. The user visits a web interface, uploads two PDF documents (an Expense Software Report containing receipt records and a Credit Card Statement containing expense transactions), and receives automated matching results. The system produces an Excel report highlighting expenses lacking receipts or project/GL codes, and generates a CSV export file containing only fully documented expenses ready for system import.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has an Expense Software Report PDF and a Credit Card Statement PDF, **When** they upload both files through the web interface, **Then** the system processes both documents, extracts expense and receipt data using defined patterns, and matches expenses to receipts

2. **Given** the system has processed the uploaded PDFs, **When** matching is complete, **Then** the system generates an Excel report listing all expenses missing receipts or project/GL codes with employee details

3. **Given** the matching analysis is complete, **When** the system identifies employees with all expenses fully receipted and coded, **Then** it generates a CSV file in pvault format containing only those complete records

4. **Given** a user has previously uploaded files and received reports, **When** they return to the session and upload an updated Expense Software Report PDF, **Then** the system re-analyzes expenses against the new receipt data and generates updated Excel and CSV reports

5. **Given** the system is processing PDF files, **When** extracting employee information from the Credit Card Statement, **Then** it correctly identifies Employee ID (4-6 digits), name, and card number (handling 16-digit, 4-4-4-4 formatted, and masked formats)

6. **Given** the system is analyzing transactions, **When** it encounters total sections in the Credit Card Statement, **Then** it accurately identifies "Totals For Card Nbr:" or "Totals For:" markers and extracts associated transaction totals

### Edge Cases

- When a PDF file is corrupted or cannot be parsed, the system displays a specific error message and allows viewing partial results from any successfully parsed sections or the other PDF file
- What happens when an employee appears in the Credit Card Statement but has no matching records in the Expense Software Report?
- What happens when a Credit Card Statement spans multiple pages with tables split across page boundaries?
- How does the system handle employees who have some expenses with receipts and others without?
- What happens when card numbers appear in different formats (full 16-digit vs masked) for the same employee?
- When regex patterns fail to match expected data in either PDF, the system displays a parsing error message and presents any partial data successfully extracted
- How does the system handle special characters or formatting inconsistencies in employee names?
- What happens when a user uploads files in the wrong order or uploads the same file twice?
- What happens when multiple expenses for the same employee have identical amounts (e.g., two $25.00 transactions)?
- What happens when a receipt exists but the expense amount differs by cents due to rounding?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web interface where users can upload exactly two PDF files simultaneously or sequentially

- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an Expense Software Report PDF that contains receipt records with GL or project codes for each user

- **FR-003**: System MUST accept a Credit Card Statement PDF that contains expense transaction tables for multiple users, potentially spanning multiple pages

- **FR-004**: System MUST extract employee information from Credit Card Statement PDFs using a pattern that captures Employee ID (4-6 digits), name, and card number in 16-digit, 4-4-4-4 formatted, or masked formats

- **FR-005**: System MUST identify transaction total sections using patterns matching "Totals For Card Nbr:" or "Totals For:" markers

- **FR-006**: System MUST extract transaction total amounts from identified total sections

- **FR-007**: System MUST validate extracted Employee IDs as alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores (case-insensitive)

- **FR-008**: System MUST validate any UUIDs encountered using the 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal format (case-insensitive)

- **FR-009**: System MUST match credit card expenses against receipt records from the Expense Software Report

- **FR-010**: System MUST match expenses to receipts by comparing employee identifier and transaction amount. An expense is considered matched (has a receipt) if a receipt record exists for the same employee with an identical dollar amount. Expenses without matching employee+amount combinations are flagged as missing receipts

- **FR-011**: System MUST identify expenses that are missing project or GL codes

- **FR-012**: System MUST generate an Excel report listing all expenses missing receipts and/or project/GL codes, including employee identification details

- **FR-013**: System MUST generate a CSV file in pvault format with the following columns in order: Transaction ID, Transaction Date, Transaction Amount, Transaction Name, Vendor Invoice #, Invoice Date, Header Description, Job, Phase, Cost Type, GL Account, Item Description, UM, Tax, Pay Type, Card Holder, Credit Card Number, Credit Card Vendor

- **FR-014**: CSV export MUST include ONLY employees whose expenses are all fully receipted and coded (100% complete)

- **FR-015**: CSV export MUST exclude any employee who has one or more expenses missing receipts or GL/project codes

- **FR-016**: System MUST persist session data to allow users to return later and continue working with the same expense data

- **FR-017**: Users MUST be able to upload a new Expense Software Report PDF to an existing session

- **FR-018**: System MUST re-analyze all expenses against the updated receipt data when a new Expense Software Report is uploaded

- **FR-019**: System MUST generate updated Excel and CSV reports after re-analysis, reflecting the current matching state

- **FR-020**: System MUST handle Credit Card Statement tables that span multiple pages without data loss

- **FR-021**: System MUST provide detailed progress feedback during processing, including both percentage completion (0-100%) and descriptive step updates (e.g., "Parsing Credit Card Statement...", "Extracting employee data...", "Matching expenses to receipts...", "Generating Excel report...", "Generating CSV export...")

- **FR-022**: System MUST handle PDF parsing errors gracefully by displaying a specific error message describing the parsing failure while still allowing users to view any successfully parsed data from the other PDF file or partially extracted records. Users can continue working with partial results

- **FR-023**: Excel report MUST include a Status column that clearly identifies the issue type for each expense with one of three values: "Missing Receipt", "Missing GL Code", or "Missing Both"

### Key Entities

- **Expense Transaction**: Represents a single credit card charge including employee identifier, transaction date, description, amount, and card number. Tracked to determine if it has matching receipt and GL/project code

- **Receipt Record**: Represents documentation from the Expense Software Report including employee identifier, receipt identifier, associated GL or project code, and amount. Used to match against expense transactions

- **Employee**: Represents a person with expenses, identified by Employee ID (4-6 digits), name, and credit card number. Has a collection of expense transactions and determines eligibility for CSV export based on completion status

- **Session**: Represents a user's work session containing uploaded PDFs, extracted data, matching results, and generated reports. Persisted to allow users to return and update receipt data

- **Matching Result**: Represents the outcome of comparing an expense transaction against receipt records, indicating whether receipt and GL/project code are present or missing

- **Excel Report**: Generated document listing all expenses with missing receipts or GL/project codes, organized by employee. Includes a Status column with values "Missing Receipt", "Missing GL Code", or "Missing Both" to clearly identify each expense's issue type

- **CSV Export (pvault format)**: Generated file containing only complete expense records for employees with 100% receipted and coded transactions. Contains 18 columns: Transaction ID, Transaction Date, Transaction Amount, Transaction Name, Vendor Invoice #, Invoice Date, Header Description, Job, Phase, Cost Type, GL Account, Item Description, UM, Tax, Pay Type, Card Holder, Credit Card Number, Credit Card Vendor
