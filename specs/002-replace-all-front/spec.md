# Feature Specification: Replace Front-End UI with shadcn/ui Blue Theme

**Feature Branch**: `002-replace-all-front`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "replace all front end UI components with shadcn components and use the blue theme from https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to migrate all UI components to shadcn/ui with blue theme
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers maintaining the UI, End users viewing the application
   ‚Üí Actions: Replace existing UI components, Apply blue theme styling
   ‚Üí Data: CSS variables, component configurations, visual design tokens
   ‚Üí Constraints: Maintain existing functionality, preserve component behavior
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí NONE - Requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Visual consistency testing required
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Theme configuration, Component library
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What accessibility standard level must the blue theme contrast ratios meet? ‚Üí A: No specific standard, visual review only
- Q: How should the system handle browsers that don't support OKLCH color format? ‚Üí A: Display warning to user, continue with degraded colors
- Q: What components are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this blue theme migration? ‚Üí A: none
- Q: How should visual theme consistency be validated after migration? ‚Üí A: Component storybook review
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable page load impact from theme migration? ‚Üí A: No specific performance target

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users interact with a visually consistent expense reconciliation interface that uses a professional blue color scheme throughout all components. All interactive elements (buttons, cards, inputs, alerts, forms, progress indicators) display with the blue theme, providing a cohesive and polished user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they view any page, **Then** all UI components display with the blue theme color scheme (blue primary colors, matching secondary and accent colors)
2. **Given** a user interacts with forms and buttons, **When** they hover or focus on elements, **Then** visual feedback uses blue theme colors consistently
3. **Given** a user switches between light and dark mode, **When** the theme changes, **Then** blue theme colors adapt appropriately for both modes
4. **Given** a user views the upload form, progress display, and results panels, **When** navigating between workflow steps, **Then** all components maintain visual consistency with the blue theme
5. **Given** existing functionality (file uploads, progress tracking, results display), **When** UI components are updated, **Then** all features continue to work exactly as before
6. **Given** the migration is complete, **When** reviewing the component storybook, **Then** all components display consistent blue theme styling across all states and variants

### Edge Cases
- What happens when browser doesn't support OKLCH color format? System displays a warning message to the user and continues operation with degraded color rendering
- How does system handle custom theme overrides? Blue theme should be applied at the base level without conflicts
- What happens with third-party components? Only shadcn/ui components are affected; other elements remain unchanged

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all UI components using the blue theme color palette from shadcn/ui (no components excluded from migration)
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply blue theme colors to all primary interactive elements (buttons, links, focus states)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain consistent blue theme styling across all workflow steps (upload, processing, results)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support both light and dark mode variants of the blue theme
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing component functionality during theme migration
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply blue theme CSS variables to all shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, Label, Alert, Progress, Form)
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure visual contrast is verified through visual review (no specific WCAG compliance required)
- **FR-008**: System MUST use shadcn/ui components consistently throughout the application
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain responsive design and layout with updated components
- **FR-010**: System MUST display loading states, error states, and success states using blue theme colors
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect OKLCH color format support and display a user warning when unsupported, allowing continued operation with degraded rendering
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide a component storybook for visual validation of blue theme consistency across all component states and variants
- **FR-013**: System SHOULD minimize page load performance impact from theme migration (no specific performance target required)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Configuration**: Defines the blue color palette using OKLCH color format, including primary, secondary, accent, muted, and destructive colors for both light and dark modes
- **Component Library**: Collection of shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, Label, Alert, Progress, Form) that consume theme configuration and render with blue styling
- **CSS Variables**: Design tokens that map theme colors to Tailwind utility classes, enabling consistent styling across all components
