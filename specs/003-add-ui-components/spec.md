# Feature Specification: Session Management UI Components

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-ui-components`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add UI components for session management including opening a previous session, renaming the session, updating the session but only accepting an update receipts file, and the session should be called month as each month likely will be a unique session.  Old sessions should be able to have reports generated from them for historic data extraction"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí COMPLETE: Monthly session management with naming, updates, and historical access
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Expense processors, Accountants
   ‚Üí Actions: Create months, rename sessions, update receipts, access history
   ‚Üí Data: Monthly expense sessions, receipt files, historical reports
   ‚Üí Constraints: Only accept receipt files for updates, monthly organization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Session retention period marked for clarification
   ‚Üí Maximum sessions limit marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí COMPLETE: Monthly workflow with session management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí COMPLETE: All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí COMPLETE: Month sessions, receipt updates, reports
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What is the data retention period for monthly sessions? ‚Üí A: 1 year (standard business cycle)
- Q: What is the maximum number of sessions that can be stored simultaneously? ‚Üí A: 24 sessions (two years of monthly data)
- Q: How should the system handle receipt update failures? ‚Üí A: Show error message and preserve original session unchanged

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an expense processor, I work with monthly expense reconciliation cycles where I need to:
1. Process credit card statements and expense reports for each month
2. Name and organize sessions by month (e.g., "January 2024", "Q1 Processing")
3. Return to previous months to upload additional receipts when they arrive late
4. Generate historical reports for auditing and compliance purposes
5. Maintain multiple months concurrently during month-end overlaps

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm starting expense processing for a new month, **When** I create a session, **Then** I can name it with a month identifier and it becomes my active session
2. **Given** I have completed processing for March 2024, **When** I receive additional receipts for March, **Then** I can reopen that session, upload only the new receipts file, and regenerate updated reports
3. **Given** I need to review February 2024 data for an audit, **When** I browse my previous sessions, **Then** I can open February's session and download the Excel and CSV reports without re-processing
4. **Given** I have sessions for multiple months, **When** I view my session list, **Then** I see each month clearly labeled with processing date and completion status
5. **Given** I'm working on April processing while March is still open, **When** I switch between sessions, **Then** each maintains its own state and data independently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to upload a credit card statement to an existing session instead of receipts?
- How does the system handle corrupted session data or missing backend files?
- What occurs when I attempt to access a session older than the retention period?
- How does the system respond when maximum session storage limit is reached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new monthly sessions with custom names
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a browser/list interface showing all saved sessions with names and creation dates
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to rename existing sessions after creation
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to select and open any previous session to view its results
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an "Update Receipts" feature for existing sessions that accepts only expense report files
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent uploading credit card statements to existing sessions during updates
- **FR-007**: System MUST re-process expense matching when new receipts are uploaded to existing sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate fresh Excel and CSV reports after receipt updates
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to download reports from any historical session without re-processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain session independence (changes to one month don't affect others)
- **FR-011**: System MUST indicate session status (Processing, Complete, Updated, Error) in the session browser
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain session data for 1 year from creation date, automatically purging expired sessions
- **FR-013**: System MUST limit total stored sessions to 24 maximum, displaying warning when approaching limit
- **FR-014**: System MUST show progress feedback during receipt update processing
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve original session data when receipt updates fail, displaying clear error message without modifying existing data

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Month Session**: Represents a monthly expense processing cycle with unique name, creation date, processing status, and associated files and reports
- **Receipt Update**: Represents an operation to add new expense receipts to an existing month session, triggering re-analysis and report regeneration
- **Session Browser**: Interface component displaying all available sessions with metadata for selection and management
- **Historical Report**: Previously generated Excel/CSV reports that can be re-downloaded without re-processing
