# Feature Specification: Simplify Dark Mode Toggle to Icon

**Feature Branch**: `004-change-the-dark`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "change the dark mode selector to be less obnoxious.  Just an icon in the top right of the page should work."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to simplify dark mode toggle from button to icon in top right
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users viewing the application
   ‚Üí Actions: Toggle between light and dark themes using icon
   ‚Üí Data: Theme preference (light/dark state)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must be less visually prominent, positioned in top right
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí NONE - Requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Visual simplification and positioning testing required
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Theme state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: How should the icon support users with assistive technology? ‚Üí A: Match existing accessibility level of other interactive elements in the app
- Q: Should the theme toggle icon respect the user's operating system/browser dark mode preference on first visit (before they've manually set a preference)? ‚Üí A: Yes, detect and apply system preference initially, then respect user's manual choice
- Q: How should the icon behave when a user hovers over it (before clicking)? ‚Üí A: Both visual feedback AND tooltip
- Q: What should happen if the user's browser has localStorage disabled or blocked (e.g., private browsing mode)? ‚Üí A: Gracefully degrade: use session-only memory (theme persists during session, resets on close)
- Q: Should the icon size be fixed or responsive to different screen sizes? ‚Üí A: Responsive (slightly larger on mobile/touch devices for easier tapping)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users who want to switch between light and dark modes should be able to do so quickly without the toggle being visually distracting. The current centered button implementation is too prominent. Users expect a subtle icon control in a standard location (top right corner) that blends into the interface when not needed but remains easily accessible.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the application in light mode, **When** they look at the top right corner of the page, **Then** they see a small moon/dark mode icon
2. **Given** a user clicks the dark mode icon, **When** the theme switches to dark mode, **Then** the icon changes to a sun/light mode icon
3. **Given** a user is viewing the application, **When** they look at the page layout, **Then** the theme toggle no longer appears as a centered prominent button
4. **Given** a user has set their theme preference, **When** they reload the page or return later, **Then** their theme choice is preserved
5. **Given** a user visits the application for the first time with no saved preference, **When** the page loads, **Then** the theme matches their operating system's dark mode setting
6. **Given** a user with system dark mode enabled manually switches to light mode, **When** they reload the page, **Then** the application remains in light mode (manual choice overrides system preference)
7. **Given** a user hovers over the theme toggle icon, **When** the cursor is over the icon, **Then** visual feedback appears (color change, scale, or glow) and a tooltip displays describing the toggle action
8. **Given** a user on a mobile or touch device, **When** they view the theme toggle icon, **Then** the icon appears slightly larger than on desktop to accommodate touch interaction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has previously saved a theme preference? (Icon should reflect the current active theme)
- How does the icon appear in both light and dark modes? (Must be visible and accessible in both themes)
- What visual feedback occurs when clicking the icon? (Immediate theme change with appropriate icon swap)
- What happens when a user hovers over the icon? (Visual feedback plus tooltip indicating the action)
- What happens when localStorage is disabled or blocked? (Theme toggle still functions using session-only storage; preference persists within session but resets on browser close)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a theme toggle icon in the top right corner of the page
- **FR-002**: Theme toggle MUST be less visually prominent than the current centered button implementation
- **FR-003**: Icon MUST clearly indicate the current theme state (e.g., moon for light mode, sun for dark mode)
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to click the icon to toggle between light and dark modes
- **FR-005**: System MUST swap the icon when theme changes (moon ‚Üî sun)
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing theme switching functionality (localStorage persistence, theme application)
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect and apply the user's operating system dark mode preference on first visit when no saved preference exists
- **FR-011**: System MUST prioritize user's manually selected theme preference over system preference once a manual selection has been made
- **FR-007**: Icon MUST remain visible and accessible in both light and dark themes
- **FR-008**: Theme toggle button currently centered below the header MUST be removed
- **FR-009**: Icon MUST provide the same accessibility support as other interactive elements in the application
- **FR-012**: Icon MUST display visual hover feedback (such as color change, scale effect, or glow)
- **FR-013**: Icon MUST show a tooltip on hover that describes the toggle action (e.g., "Switch to dark mode" or "Switch to light mode")
- **FR-014**: System MUST gracefully handle localStorage unavailability by using session-only memory for theme preference
- **FR-015**: When localStorage is unavailable, theme preference MUST persist during the current browser session but reset to system preference when the browser is closed or session ends
- **FR-016**: Icon size MUST be responsive, appearing slightly larger on mobile and touch devices to ensure easy tapping
- **FR-017**: Icon size on desktop MUST remain subtle and unobtrusive while still being clearly visible

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme State**: Represents the current theme mode (light or dark), persisted in browser storage, reflected by icon visual
