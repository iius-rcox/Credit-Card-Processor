# Feature Specification: Better Status Updates

**Feature Branch**: `006-better-status-updates`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Better Status Updates

Implement backend processing to show much more detailed progress status.  It should have separate phases including upload and counters based on progress through the total number of regex matches as it runs through them"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Need for detailed progress tracking during PDF processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users uploading PDFs
   ‚Üí Actions: Monitor processing progress in real-time
   ‚Üí Data: Progress phases, regex match counters, completion percentages
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must show granular progress, not just 90% stuck
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Update frequency for progress not specified
   ‚Üí Number of processing phases not detailed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User uploads PDFs and sees detailed progress
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Progress events, processing phases, extraction status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-08
- Q: What is the acceptable update frequency for progress indicators to avoid overwhelming the UI while maintaining perceived responsiveness? ‚Üí A: Batched updates (every 2-3 seconds)
- Q: Should the system preserve partial extraction results when processing fails mid-phase, allowing users to access what was successfully extracted before the failure? ‚Üí A: No, discard all results on failure
- Q: When multiple users upload files concurrently, how should progress updates be isolated to prevent users from seeing each other's processing status? ‚Üí A: No isolation needed (single-user system)
- Q: What minimum granularity should be shown for extraction progress to provide meaningful updates without exposing internal complexity? ‚Üí A: Per-page progress (e.g., "Page 3 of 10")
- Q: How should the system handle progress display when processing multiple PDFs - should progress be shown per-file or as aggregate across all files? ‚Üí A: Both per-file and aggregate (detailed and summary views)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user uploading credit card statements and receipt PDFs for reconciliation, I want to see detailed progress updates during processing so that I understand what's happening and can estimate how long it will take, rather than seeing a progress bar stuck at 90% for an extended period.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded two PDF files, **When** processing begins, **Then** the system shows both aggregate progress across all files and individual progress per file
2. **Given** the system is extracting data from PDFs, **When** processing pages, **Then** the system displays page-level progress (e.g., "Processing page 3 of 10")
3. **Given** the system has multiple processing phases, **When** each phase completes, **Then** the progress indicator advances to reflect the current phase (e.g., "Upload: 100%", "Extraction: 45%", "Matching: 0%")
4. **Given** processing is in progress, **When** the user views the progress display, **Then** they see specific status messages (not generic "Processing...") that indicate what operation is currently running
5. **Given** all processing phases complete, **When** the final phase finishes, **Then** the progress indicator shows 100% and status changes to "Complete"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when processing fails during a specific phase? (Progress should show which phase failed, and all partial results are discarded)
- How does the system handle very large files with thousands of regex matches? (Progress updates should batch every 2-3 seconds to avoid UI overload)
- What if processing takes longer than expected in one phase? (User should still see progress within that phase, not appear frozen)
- How should progress be displayed if the user navigates away and comes back? (Progress should be retrievable from the session)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Progress Tracking**
- **FR-001**: System MUST divide processing into distinct phases (at minimum: upload, extraction, matching)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide progress percentage for each processing phase
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide status updates that describe the current operation being performed, batched every 2-3 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST track extraction progress at page granularity (e.g., "Page 5 of 12")
- **FR-005**: System MUST update progress at 2-3 second intervals to maintain perceived activity without overwhelming the UI
- **FR-018**: System MUST display both aggregate progress (overall across all files) and per-file progress when processing multiple PDFs
- **FR-019**: System MUST show which specific file is currently being processed in the detailed view

**Status Information**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the current processing phase name (e.g., "Extracting transactions", "Matching receipts")
- **FR-007**: System MUST show quantitative progress within phases at page granularity (e.g., "Page 3 of 10")
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist progress state so the user can refresh the page without losing progress visibility (single-user system)
- **FR-009**: System MUST indicate overall completion percentage across all phases
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide estimated or relative progress (not just "processing" indefinitely)

**User Experience**
- **FR-011**: Progress display MUST update without requiring user interaction (automatic polling or push updates every 2-3 seconds)
- **FR-012**: System MUST show meaningful status messages that explain what's happening (not generic "Processing...")
- **FR-013**: The user MUST be able to see progress updates after navigating away and returning (single-user system)
- **FR-014**: Progress updates MUST include enough detail to reassure users that processing is actively occurring

**Error Handling**
- **FR-015**: System MUST indicate which phase failed if processing encounters an error
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide enough context in error messages to understand what went wrong during processing
- **FR-017**: System MUST discard all partial results if processing fails at any phase (no incomplete data persisted)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Processing Phase**: Represents a major stage of PDF processing (upload, extraction, matching). Has a name, order, and completion status.
- **Progress Event**: Update about processing status batched every 2-3 seconds. Contains phase identifier, percentage complete, current operation description, and counters (e.g., items processed / total items).
- **Extraction Progress**: Tracks progress at page granularity. Includes current page number, total pages, and items found per page.
- **Session Processing State**: Persistent representation of processing progress. Stores current phase, phase-specific progress, overall completion percentage, and status messages.
- **Multi-File Progress**: Aggregates progress across multiple files. Contains list of files with individual progress, current file being processed, and combined completion percentage.
