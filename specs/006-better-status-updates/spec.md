# Feature Specification: Better Status Updates

**Feature Branch**: `006-better-status-updates`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Better Status Updates

Implement backend processing to show much more detailed progress status.  It should have separate phases including upload and counters based on progress through the total number of regex matches as it runs through them"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Need for detailed progress tracking during PDF processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users uploading PDFs
   ‚Üí Actions: Monitor processing progress in real-time
   ‚Üí Data: Progress phases, regex match counters, completion percentages
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must show granular progress, not just 90% stuck
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Update frequency for progress not specified
   ‚Üí Number of processing phases not detailed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User uploads PDFs and sees detailed progress
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Progress events, processing phases, extraction status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user uploading credit card statements and receipt PDFs for reconciliation, I want to see detailed progress updates during processing so that I understand what's happening and can estimate how long it will take, rather than seeing a progress bar stuck at 90% for an extended period.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded two PDF files, **When** processing begins, **Then** the system shows an initial upload phase with "Upload complete" or similar confirmation
2. **Given** the system is extracting data from PDFs, **When** processing regex patterns, **Then** the system displays a counter showing "Processing pattern X of Y" or "Extracted N transactions so far"
3. **Given** the system has multiple processing phases, **When** each phase completes, **Then** the progress indicator advances to reflect the current phase (e.g., "Upload: 100%", "Extraction: 45%", "Matching: 0%")
4. **Given** processing is in progress, **When** the user views the progress display, **Then** they see specific status messages (not generic "Processing...") that indicate what operation is currently running
5. **Given** all processing phases complete, **When** the final phase finishes, **Then** the progress indicator shows 100% and status changes to "Complete"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when processing fails during a specific phase? (Progress should show which phase failed)
- How does the system handle very large files with thousands of regex matches? (Progress updates should not overwhelm the UI with too-frequent updates)
- What if processing takes longer than expected in one phase? (User should still see progress within that phase, not appear frozen)
- How should progress be displayed if the user navigates away and comes back? (Progress should be retrievable from the session)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Progress Tracking**
- **FR-001**: System MUST divide processing into distinct phases (at minimum: upload, extraction, matching)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide progress percentage for each processing phase
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide real-time status updates that describe the current operation being performed
- **FR-004**: System MUST track progress through regex pattern matching with counters showing current match number and total matches
- **FR-005**: System MUST update progress frequently enough that users perceive continuous activity (not stuck at one percentage)

**Status Information**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the current processing phase name (e.g., "Extracting transactions", "Matching receipts")
- **FR-007**: System MUST show quantitative progress within phases (e.g., "15 of 47 transactions extracted")
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist progress state so users can refresh the page without losing progress visibility
- **FR-009**: System MUST indicate overall completion percentage across all phases
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide estimated or relative progress (not just "processing" indefinitely)

**User Experience**
- **FR-011**: Progress display MUST update without requiring user interaction (automatic polling or push updates)
- **FR-012**: System MUST show meaningful status messages that explain what's happening (not generic "Processing...")
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to see progress updates for their session after navigating away and returning
- **FR-014**: Progress updates MUST include enough detail to reassure users that processing is actively occurring

**Error Handling**
- **FR-015**: System MUST indicate which phase failed if processing encounters an error
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide enough context in error messages to understand what went wrong during processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Processing Phase**: Represents a major stage of PDF processing (upload, extraction, matching). Has a name, order, and completion status.
- **Progress Event**: Real-time update about processing status. Contains phase identifier, percentage complete, current operation description, and counters (e.g., items processed / total items).
- **Extraction Progress**: Tracks progress through regex pattern matching. Includes current pattern being matched, number of matches found, and position in the document.
- **Session Processing State**: Persistent representation of processing progress. Stores current phase, phase-specific progress, overall completion percentage, and status messages.
