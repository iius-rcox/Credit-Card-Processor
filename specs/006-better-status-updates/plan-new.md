# Implementation Plan: Better Status Updates

**Branch**: 006-better-status-updates | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from /specs/006-better-status-updates/spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

1. Load feature spec from Input path
2. Fill Technical Context
3. Fill Constitution Check section
4. Evaluate Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 research
6. Execute Phase 1 design & contracts
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 task generation approach
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command


## Summary
Implement detailed progress tracking for PDF processing operations across distinct phases (upload, extraction, matching) with page-level granularity. Progress updates batched every 2-3 seconds showing both aggregate and per-file progress for multiple PDFs.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (backend), TypeScript/Next.js 15 (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Next.js 15, React 19, WebSocket/Server-Sent Events
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (session state, progress tracking)
**Testing**: pytest (backend), vitest + playwright (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux server backend, browser frontend)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Progress updates every 2-3 seconds, <50ms update latency
**Constraints**: Single-user system, discard partial results on failure
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-file processing, page-level progress tracking, 3+ processing phases

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: Constitution file is a template. Checking against standard practices:

- ? **Library-First**: Progress tracking as reusable service components
- ? **Testing**: Contract tests for progress API, integration tests for scenarios
- ? **Observability**: Progress events are structured state updates
- ? **Simplicity**: Building on existing patterns, minimal new abstractions

**Initial Assessment**: PASS

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning described
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
