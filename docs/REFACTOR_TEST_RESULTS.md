# Feature 008: PDF Extraction Refactor - Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Branch**: `008-refactor-pdf-extraction`
**Tester**: Claude Code (Automated)

## Test Summary

### ✅ Test Status: PASSED

The refactored PDF extraction architecture successfully processes uploads with inline extraction, eliminating temporary storage and providing immediate feedback.

## Test Environment

- **Backend**: Docker container (credit-card-backend)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (credit-card-postgres)
- **Celery Worker**: Docker container (credit-card-celery-worker)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (http://localhost:3000)
- **Test File**: backend/test-upload.pdf (placeholder PDF)

## Test Execution

### Test Case 1: Small PDF Upload (Inline Extraction)

**Objective**: Verify that PDF extraction happens inline during upload without temp storage

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload test-upload.pdf to both file inputs
3. Click "Process Reports"
4. Monitor progress and final status

**Results**:

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Upload completes | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| Session status transitions | extracting → matching → completed | extracting → matching → completed | ✅ |
| Progress shows extracting phase | Yes | Yes (0%, 30%, 60%) | ✅ |
| Matching task queued | Yes | Yes (tasks.match_session) | ✅ |
| No temp files created | Yes | Yes (no temp storage references) | ✅ |
| Response time | < 5s | ~0.3s | ✅ |

**Session Details**:
- Session ID: `fd08bbef-65f6-4b82-b429-22c30690a080`
- Status: `completed`
- Upload Count: 2 files
- Total Transactions: 0 (expected - test PDF has no transaction data)
- Current Phase: null (completed)

**Progress Tracking**:
```
Phase 1 (0%):   "Starting extraction of 2 file(s)..."
Phase 2 (30%):  "Extracting data from test-upload.pdf... (1/2)"
Phase 3 (60%):  "Extraction complete. 0 transaction(s) extracted from 2 file(s)."
```

**Celery Task Execution**:
```
✓ CELERY TASK STARTED: match_session_task
  Task ID: 36a15764-9da6-4b91-9f8f-8a810db840de
  Session ID: fd08bbef-65f6-4b82-b429-22c30690a080

✓ Matching task completed successfully
  Task execution time: 0.165s
  Matches created: 0
```

## Validation Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [x] Upload endpoint accepts PDFs
- [x] Extraction happens inline (no async delay)
- [x] Session created with 'extracting' status
- [x] Progress updates during extraction
- [x] Session transitions to 'matching' after extraction
- [x] Celery task (match_session) executes successfully
- [x] Session completes with 'completed' status

### Architecture Changes
- [x] No TEMP_STORAGE_PATH references in code
- [x] No temporary files created during upload
- [x] ExtractionService.extract_from_upload_file() method works
- [x] In-memory PDF processing (BytesIO)
- [x] Proper memory cleanup (finally blocks)
- [x] New match_session_task in tasks.py

### Database Updates
- [x] Session status constraint includes 'extracting'
- [x] Session current_phase constraint includes 'extracting'
- [x] Migration created and applied successfully
- [x] No constraint violations during upload

### Infrastructure Updates
- [x] docker-compose.yml: shared-temp volume removed
- [x] backend-deployment.yaml: volume mounts removed
- [x] celery-worker-deployment.yaml: volume mounts removed
- [x] TEMP_STORAGE_PATH env var removed

## Issues Found and Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing Dependency Injection
**Problem**: `UploadService.__init__()` signature changed but `dependencies.py` not updated
**Error**: `TypeError: UploadService.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'receipt_repo'`
**Resolution**: Updated `get_upload_service()` to inject all required dependencies
**Commit**: b61ee3c

### Issue 2: Circular Dependency Reference
**Problem**: `get_upload_service` referenced `get_extraction_service` before it was defined
**Error**: `NameError: name 'get_extraction_service' is not defined`
**Resolution**: Reordered service dependency functions
**Commit**: b61ee3c

### Issue 3: Database Constraint Missing 'extracting'
**Problem**: `chk_sessions_current_phase` constraint didn't include 'extracting' value
**Error**: `CheckViolationError: new row for relation "sessions" violates check constraint`
**Resolution**: Created migration to add 'extracting' to valid phases
**Commit**: b61ee3c

## Performance Observations

- **Upload Processing Time**: ~0.3 seconds (2 placeholder PDFs)
- **Extraction Phase**: Completed inline during request
- **Matching Task**: Executed in 0.165 seconds
- **Total Time**: < 1 second from upload to completed

**Note**: Test PDFs were placeholders with no actual transaction data. Real credit card statements will take longer but extraction still happens inline.

## Memory Observations

- Backend container stable during upload
- No OOM errors or memory warnings
- Proper garbage collection after each file
- No temp file accumulation

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Small PDF testing - PASSED
2. ⏭️ Test with real credit card statement PDFs containing transactions
3. ⏭️ Test with large PDFs (100-200MB)
4. ⏭️ Load testing with concurrent uploads

### Before Production
1. Monitor backend memory usage with real PDFs
2. Verify extraction regex patterns work with actual statements
3. Test error handling (invalid PDFs, corrupted files)
4. Update API documentation (200 OK vs 202 Accepted)

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor for 7 days in production
2. Verify no memory issues with large PDFs
3. Delete Azure Files resources (PVC, PV, secret)
4. Update CLAUDE.md with final production validation

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**

The refactored architecture successfully:
- Eliminates temporary storage completely
- Processes PDFs inline during upload
- Provides immediate progress feedback
- Queues lightweight matching tasks only
- Completes full workflow: upload → extract → match → complete

**Recommendation**: Proceed with testing using real credit card statement PDFs to validate transaction extraction, then move to production deployment after successful validation.
