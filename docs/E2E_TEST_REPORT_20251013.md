-- Session count by status
failed: 1
```

## Processing Stuck Bug Fix Verification

### Status Transition Validation

**Test:** Verify all status transitions are logged
**Result:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
```
Session 1a9aec8e... status transition: processing -> completed
Session 4f3b6186... status transition: processing -> completed
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Transitions are logged with session ID
- ✅ Old and new status shown
- ✅ No constraint violations
- ✅ Validation method working

### Database Constraint Verification

**Test:** Verify constraint includes all required statuses
**Result:** ✅ PASS

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT pg_get_constraintdef(oid) FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname = 'chk_sessions_status';
```

**Result:**
```
CHECK (status IN ('processing', 'extracting', 'matching', 'completed', 'failed', 'expired'))
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All 6 statuses included
- ✅ 'matching' and 'extracting' added successfully
- ✅ Constraint active in production

### Stuck Session Detection

**Test:** Query for any stuck sessions after all tests
**Result:** ✅ PASS

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions
WHERE status = 'processing'
AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

**Result:** 0 stuck sessions

**Verification:**
- ✅ No sessions stuck in processing
- ✅ All test sessions completed
- ✅ Old stuck session cleaned up

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: PDF Extraction Not Working (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Description:** 0 transactions and 0 receipts extracted from PDFs

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Regex Pattern Mismatch:** Current patterns expect specific WEX Fleet format
2. **Unknown PDF Format:** Actual test PDFs may have different format
3. **No Format Documentation:** PDF structure not documented

**Evidence:**
```
[EXTRACTION] Extracted 0 transactions from PDF
[EXTRACTION] No transactions extracted - regex pattern may not match PDF format
```

**Impact:**
- Sessions complete successfully (✅ good)
- But no useful data extracted (⚠️ needs fix)
- Reports are empty (no transactions to reconcile)

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Extract sample text from test PDFs
2. Analyze actual format and column layout
3. Update regex patterns in extraction_service.py:72-108
4. Add debug logging for regex matching
5. Create unit tests with actual PDF samples

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

   - Create sample PDFs with known format for testing
   - Document expected format in README

### Long-Term Enhancements
1. **Flexible PDF Parsing:**
   - Support multiple PDF formats
   - Auto-detect format from PDF structure
   - Configurable regex patterns

2. **Better Error Messages:**
   - "No transactions found - PDF format may not match"
   - Suggest format documentation

3. **Extraction Validation:**

## Conclusion

### Primary Objective: ✅ ACHIEVED

**The processing stuck bug is completely fixed:**
- Sessions no longer get stuck in "processing" status
- Status transitions work correctly
- Database constraint properly supports all statuses
- Validation and logging implemented
- Production deployment successful

**Evidence:**
- 3 test sessions all completed successfully
- 0 stuck sessions in production
- Status transitions logged in all cases
- No constraint violations observed

### Secondary Finding: PDF Extraction Issue

**Separate issue identified:**
- PDFs upload and process successfully
- But 0 transactions extracted (regex pattern mismatch)
- This does NOT affect session completion
- Requires separate investigation and fix

**Recommendation:** Create a follow-up task to analyze PDF format and update extraction patterns.
